Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election 
Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory

Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail 
I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse 
The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306 
.@CNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do

Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years 
The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce 
Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone

Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice 
The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it 
Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena

The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag 
Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends she knows me well--wrong 
Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope 
.@CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life 
I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster

The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits 
Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans 
RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country 
While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all 
Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER 
Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls

Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA 
It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails &amp; the veteran who said she should be in jail

Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC. #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou 
With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted 
Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto

Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets.... Cont: 
This is my pledge to the American people: 
'It's just a 2-point race, Clinton 38%, Trump 36%'

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad 
"Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents 
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so 
It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false 
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose 
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm 
If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20 
The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never sai 
The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something 
The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life 
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary 
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department 
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs 
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said 
When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea 
This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart 
Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice 
Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable 
"@RealJamesWoods: Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope. 
The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H 
I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me 
Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it

#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. 
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA 
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better 
Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won rating 
#CrookedHillary 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster 
Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD 
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes 
Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world 
Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety 
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street 
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words 
Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO 
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough 
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD 
Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st 
As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv 
Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. 
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep 
I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention 
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated 
You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkell 
For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia 
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy 
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here 
Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed

Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time 
Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated 
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs 
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself 
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air 
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke 
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance 
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie 
If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same 
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened 
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie 
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes m

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well

The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN 
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left 
Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets. 
Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD 
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end 
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates 
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite 
Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else 
Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPEC 
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H

"@OliMauritania: @realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals #HillaryKaine2016 
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart 
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud 
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me 
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs 
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer 
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA 
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGE 
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her 
Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing 
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight 
"@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain 
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam 
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did 
Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich 
One of the best produced, including the incredible stage &amp; set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRov 
Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times 
What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic

STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH 
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails 
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press 
In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs 
Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years 
Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you 
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST

If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her 
I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud 
It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement 
As the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions 
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's ove

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes 
Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money 
Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening 
Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have don

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow 
If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions 
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking 
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge 
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others 
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity 
Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad! 
Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. 
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know 
The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time 
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton 
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs 
#CrookedHillary is not qualified! 
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out 
Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry 
This election is a choice between law, order &amp; safety - or chaos, crime &amp; violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYo 
For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need

I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network 
The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid 
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe 
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation 
New poll - thank you! #Trump2016 
Way to go @serenawilliams - you are a true champion. Proud of you

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live 
I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitic 
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C 
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City 
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed Cit 
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies 
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come 
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj 
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement 
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT 
I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out 
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Wi

The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment 
It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again 
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace 
On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy 
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays 
With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails 
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked 
I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa 
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people 
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid 
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star 
Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst 
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change 
The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this 
In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed 
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught 
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures. 
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac 
"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED! 
On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil 
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt 
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know 
Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it 
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged 
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid

Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist. We must get tough. 
.@TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning. Keep up the good work 
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence 
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter 
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan 
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal 
One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. 
Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President? She will destroy them!

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support so 
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful 
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call 
George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad call

Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids 
Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night 
Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech. She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton. 
Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou 
Here is another CNN lie. The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility. I’m not watching it much anymore. 
CNN, which is totally biased in favor of Clinton, should apologize. They knew they were wrong. 
RT @ScottAdamsSays: Trump's speech today is the best persuasion I have ever seen. Game over. Now running unopposed: 
Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border 
On immigration, I’m consulting with our immigration officers &amp; our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street 
Obama &amp; Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, &amp; start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration 
Hillary Clinton’s open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyo 
SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic &amp; African-American workers 
RT @FoxBusiness: .@JerryJrFalwell: "I was so impressed by [@realDonaldTrump's] speech yesterday. He was the best I've ever seen him."

Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement. Very much appreciated. Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying.

Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyo 
"@chrisboydbrew: @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness.. Saw your interview.You are the best! Great questions, great answers" Lou is grea 
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy 
I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm E 
Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest 
If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty &amp; judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens 
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays 
I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S 
Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T. They have bankrupted… 
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe 
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk 
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs 
Hillary says this election is about judgment. She's right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy 
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess 
When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employee

I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M 
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use 
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be toug 
"@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble 
Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade 
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace 
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness &amp; vigilance. We must be smart 
Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp; their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart &amp; vigilant 
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad 
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions 
Just like I have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great

After raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6M for Vets, I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower. JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY 
Thank you @DailyMail- for setting the failing @NYTimes story straight. This is what the NYT's should have written! 
A suggestion for the dishonest media- 
A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by @JasonDovEsq 
A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it &amp; you will never be able to vote for her. @Ed_Klein 
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement 
I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great 
Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media 
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups 
While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 &amp; 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice 
Join me in California or Montana! 5/25/16: Anaheim, California 5/26/16: Billings, Montana 
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy 
Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread.’ I will take care of our vets 
Is Hillary really protecting women? 
In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Thank you America! #Trump2016 
The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists 
Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal 
Join me on Wednesday, May 25th at the Anaheim Convention Center! #Trump2016 #MAGA Tickets: 
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can’t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America 
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women

Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs 
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity 
Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong 
"@dubilujane: I trust @realDonaldTrump more anyone ever to protect America.He WILL do the right thing for the U.S.A, without a doubt

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous

"@RBacliff: Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America's hands. No guns = no protection. Get on #TrumpTrain &amp; join @NRA to stop her. 
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary 
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster 
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton

"A Call for Unity" by Jason Greenblatt @JasonDovEsq 
Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way 
Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS 
Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance 
Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years 
I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing 
Thank you @LtStevenLRogers. We will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017! 
How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud? Thank you Rowanne 
Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness 
My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved. During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on Chin

"In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history 
The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond 
Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That’s because there were so many positive statements 
No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious &amp; libelous story they did on me 
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women

Thank you, Anthony @Scaramucci @WSJ "The Entrepreneur's Case for Trump" 
With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud

Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lie 
The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase 
Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…

Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers 
Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival

So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide 
I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there 
Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effor

RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: DEAD HEAT: CLINTON VS TRUMP 
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night 
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work 
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses 
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness 
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad 
Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION 
I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant

I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed 
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted 
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify 
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out 
I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M

Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York 
New York, we will make America great again! 
Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against hi 
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him &amp;

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun 
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work 
Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him

Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? 
This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. 
Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? 
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape 
Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there 
How come the @TODAYshow &amp; @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz 
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC 
Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight 
We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp; MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN 
Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs &amp; illegal imm 
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak &amp; losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debate 
After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me
